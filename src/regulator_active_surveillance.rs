//! 
//! This module works in the following way:
//! 
//! * Detection probability: 1\% x infection rate 
//! * If detected, then there is a 50% chance of elminating 
//!   the infection completely, or 90%. 
//! 
//! 


// Note that this implementation is to showcase the presence of the central
// located parameters, and not once spread-out over the entities.
